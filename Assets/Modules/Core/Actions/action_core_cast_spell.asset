  Description: "Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as\r\nmany monsters,
    have access to spells and can use\r\nthem to great effect in combal. Each spell
    has a casting\r\ntime, which specilies whether the caster must use an\r\naction,
    a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the\r\nspell. Casting a spell is, therefore,
    not necessarily an\r\naction. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action,\r\nso
    a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat\r\nto cast such a spell."
