  Description: "Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for\r\na particular
    circumstance before you act. To do so, you\r\ncan take lhe Ready action on your
    turn so that you can\r\nact later in the round using your reaction.\r\nFirst,
    you decide what perceivable circumstance\r\nwill trigger your reaction. Then,
    you choose lhe action\r\nyou will take in response to that trigger, or you choose\r\nto
    move up to your speed in response to it. Examples\r\ninclude \"lf lhe cultist
    steps on the trapdoor, 1'11pull the\r\nlever that opens it,\" and \"If the goblin
    steps next to me,\r\nI move away.\"\r\nWhen the lrigger occurs, you can either
    take your\r\nreaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore\r\nthe trigger.
    Remember that you can take only one\r\nreaction per round.\r\nWhen you ready a
    spell, you cast it as normal but\r\nhold its energy, which you release with your
    reaction\r\nwhen the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must'\r\nhave a casting
    time of 1 action, and holding onto the\r\nspell's magic requires concenlration
    (explained in\r\nchapter 10). If your concentration is broken, the spell\r\ndissipates
    without taking effect. For example, if you are\r\nconcentrating on the web spell
    and ready magic missiJe,\r\nyour web spell ends, and if you take damage before\r\nyou
    release magie missiJe with your reaction, your\r\nconcentration might be broken."
