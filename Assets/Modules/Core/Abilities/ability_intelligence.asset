  Description: "Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons.
    \ Intelligence is important for any character who wants to have a wide assortment
    of skills, and it is the ability associated with Smart heroes.\n  You apply your
    character's Intelligence modifier to:\n\n<indent=15%>\nThe number of skill points
    gained at each new level (though an Intelligence penalty can never reduce this
    number below 1; your character always gets at least 1 skill point per level)\n\nSearch
    and Knowledge checks, and other skill checks for which Intelligence is the key
    ability\n</indent>"
