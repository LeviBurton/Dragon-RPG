  Description: "Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons.
    This ability is important for wizards because it affects their spellcasting ability
    in many ways. Creatures of animal-level instinct have Intelligence scores of 1
    or 2. Any creature capable of understanding speech has a score of at least 3.
    A character with an Intelligence score of 0 is comatose. Some creatures do not
    possess an Intelligence score. Their modifier is +0 for any Intelligence-based
    skills or checks.\r\n\r\nYou apply your character\u2019s Intelligence modifier
    to:\r\n\r\nThe number of bonus languages your character knows at the start of
    the game. These are in addition to any starting racial languages and Common. If
    you have a penalty, you can still read and speak your racial languages unless
    your Intelligence is lower than 3.\r\nThe number of skill points gained each level,
    though your character always gets at least 1 skill point per level.\r\nAppraise,
    Craft, Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft checks.\r\nA wizard gains bonus
    spells based on his Intelligence score. The minimum Intelligence score needed
    to cast a wizard spell is 10 + the spell\u2019s level.\r\n\r\nTemporary Bonuses:
    Temporary increases to your Intelligence score give you a bonus on Intelligence-based
    skill checks. This bonus also applies to any spell DCs based on Intelligence.\r\n\r\nPermanent
    Bonuses: Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase
    the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics as
    appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points, hit points, and other
    bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.\r\n\r\nAbility
    Damage: Damage to your Intelligence score causes you to take penalties on Intelligence-based
    skill checks. The Ability Damage penalty also applies to any spell DCs based on
    Intelligence. See Ability Score Damage below."
