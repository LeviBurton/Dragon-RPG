  Name: Wisdom
  ShortName: Wis
  Description: "Wisdom describes a character\u2019s willpower, common sense, awareness,
    and intuition. Wisdom is the most important ability for clerics and druids, and
    it is also important for monks and rangers. If you want your character to have
    acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score. A
    character with a Wisdom score of 0 is incapable of rational thought and is unconscious.\r\n\r\nYou
    apply your character\u2019s Wisdom modifier to:\r\n\r\nWill saving throws (for
    negating the effects of charm person and other spells).\r\nHeal, Perception, Profession,
    Sense Motive, and Survival checks.\r\nClerics, druids, and rangers get bonus spells
    based on their Wisdom scores. The minimum Wisdom score needed to cast a cleric,
    druid, or ranger spell is 10 + the spell\u2019s level.\r\n\r\nTemporary Bonuses:
    Temporary increases to your Wisdom score give you a bonus on Wisdom-based skill
    checks and Will saving throws. This bonus also applies to any spell DCs based
    on Wisdom.\r\n\r\nPermanent Bonuses: Ability bonuses with a duration greater than
    1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all
    skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points,
    hit points, and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case
    they are removed.\r\n\r\nAbility Damage: Damage to your Wisdom score causes you
    to take penalties on Wisdom-based skill checks and Will saving throws. The Ability
    Damage penalty also applies to any spell DCs based on Wisdom. See Ability Score
    Damage below."
