  Description: "Wisdom describes a character\u2019s willpower, common sense, awareness,
    and intuition.  Compared to Intelligence, Wisdom relates to being in tune with
    and aware of one's surroundings, while Intelligence represents one's ability to
    analyze information.  An \"absent-minded professor\" has a low Wisdom score and
    a high Intelligence score.  A simpleton with low Intelligence might nevertheless
    have a great insight (high Wisdom.)  If you want your character to have keen senses,
    put a high score in Wisdom.  This is the ability associated with Dedicated heroes.\n
    \ You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:\n\n<indent=15%>\nWill saving
    throws, for using certain class talents or resisting other class talents\n\nListen,
    Spot, and Treat Injury checks, and other skill checks for which Wisdom is the
    key ability\n</indent>\n"
