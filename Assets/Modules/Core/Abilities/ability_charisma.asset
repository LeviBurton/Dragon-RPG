  Name: Charisma
  ShortName: Cha
  Description: "Charisma measures a character\u2019s personality, personal magnetism,
    ability to lead, and appearance. It is the most important ability for paladins,
    sorcerers, and bards. It is also important for clerics, since it affects their
    ability to channel energy. For undead creatures, Charisma is a measure of their
    unnatural \u201Clifeforce.\u201D Every creature has a Charisma score. A character
    with a Charisma score of 0 is not able to exert himself in any way and is unconscious.\r\n\r\nYou
    apply your character\u2019s Charisma modifier to:\r\n\r\nBluff, Diplomacy, Disguise,
    Handle Animal, Intimidate, Perform, and Use Magic Device checks.\r\nChecks that
    represent attempts to influence others.\r\nChannel energy DCs for clerics and
    paladins attempting to harm undead foes.\r\nBards, paladins, and sorcerers gain
    a number of bonus spells based on their Charisma scores. The minimum Charisma
    score needed to cast a bard, paladin, or sorcerer spell is 10 + the spell\u2019s
    level.\r\n\r\nTemporary Bonuses: Temporary increases to your Charisma score give
    you a bonus on Charisma-based skill checks. This bonus also applies to any spell
    DCs based on Charisma.\r\n\r\nPermanent Bonuses: Ability bonuses with a duration
    greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours.
    Modify all skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain
    skill points, hit points, and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately
    in case they are removed.\r\n\r\nAbility Damage: Damage to your Charisma score
    causes you to take penalties on Charisma-based skill checks. The Ability Damage
    penalty also applies to any spell DCs based off Charisma and the DC to resist
    your channeled energy. See Ability Score Damage below."
