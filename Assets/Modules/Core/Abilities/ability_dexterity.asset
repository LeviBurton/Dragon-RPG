  Name: Dexterity
  ShortName: Dex
  Description: "Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is
    the most important one for rogues, but it\u2019s also useful for characters who
    wear light or medium armor or no armor at all. This ability is vital for characters
    seeking to excel with ranged weapons, such as the bow or sling. A character with
    a Dexterity score of 0 is incapable of moving and is effectively immobile (but
    not unconscious).\r\n\r\nYou apply your character\u2019s Dexterity modifier to:\r\n\r\nRanged
    attack rolls, including those for attacks made with bows, crossbows, throwing
    axes, and many ranged spell attacks like scorching ray or searing light.\r\nArmor
    Class (AC), provided that the character can react to the attack.\r\nReflex saving
    throws, for avoiding fireballs and other attacks that you can escape by moving
    quickly.\r\nAcrobatics, Disable Device, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, Sleight of Hand,
    and Stealth checks.\r\nTemporary Bonuses: Temporary increases to your Dexterity
    score give you a bonus on Dexterity-based skill checks, Ranged attack rolls, initiative
    checks, and Reflex saving throws. The bonus also applies to your Armor Class,
    your Combat Maneuver Bonus (if you are Tiny or smaller), and your Combat Maneuver
    Defense.\r\n\r\nPermanent Bonuses: Ability bonuses with a duration greater than
    1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all
    skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points,
    hit points, and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case
    they are removed.\r\n\r\nAbility Damage: Damage to your Dexterity score causes
    you to take penalties on Dexterity-based skill checks, ranged attack rolls, initiative
    checks, and Reflex saving throws. The Ability Damage penalty also applies to your
    Armor Class, your Combat Maneuver Bonus (if you are Tiny or smaller), and to your
    Combat Maneuver Defense. See Ability Score Damage below."
