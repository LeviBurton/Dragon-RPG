  Description: "Constitution represents your character\u2019s health and stamina.
    A Constitution bonus increases a character\u2019s hit points, so the ability is
    important for all classes. Some creatures, such as undead and constructs, do not
    have a Constitution score. Their modifier is +0 for any Constitution-based checks.
    A character with a Constitution score of 0 is dead.\r\n\r\nYou apply your character\u2019s
    Constitution modifier to:\r\n\r\nEach roll of a Hit Die (though a penalty can
    never drop a result below 1\u2014that is, a character always gains at least 1
    hit point each time he advances in level).\r\nFortitude saving throws, for resisting
    poison, disease, and similar threats.\r\nIf a character\u2019s Constitution score
    changes enough to alter his or her Constitution modifier, the character\u2019s
    hit points also increase or decrease accordingly.\r\n\r\nTemporary Bonuses: Temporary
    increases to your Constitution score give you a bonus on your Fortitude saving
    throws. In addition, multiply your total Hit Dice by this bonus and add that amount
    to your current and total hit points. When the bonus ends, remove this total from
    your current and total hit points.\r\n\r\nPermanent Bonuses: Ability bonuses with
    a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after
    24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you
    to gain skill points, hit points, and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted
    separately in case they are removed.\r\n\r\nAbility Damage: Damage to your Constitution
    score causes you to take penalties on your Fortitude saving throws. In addition,
    multiply your total Hit Dice by the Ability Damage penalty and subtract that amount
    from your current and total hit points. Lost hit points are restored when the
    damage to your Constitution is healed. See Ability Score Damage below."
