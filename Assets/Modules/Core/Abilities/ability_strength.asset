  Description: "See Carrying Capacity for details on lifting and dragging.\r\n\r\nStrength
    measures muscle and physical power. This ability is important for those who engage
    in hand-to-hand (or \u201Cmelee\u201D) combat, such as fighters, monks, paladins,
    and some rangers. Strength also sets the maximum amount of weight your character
    can carry.\r\n\r\nA character with a Strength score of 0 is too weak to move in
    any way and is unconscious. Some creatures (such as incorporeal creatures) do
    not possess a Strength score and have no modifier at all to Strength-based skills
    or checks.\r\n\r\nYou apply your character\u2019s Strength modifier to:\r\n\r\nMelee
    attack rolls.\r\nDamage rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon, including
    a sling. (Exceptions: Off-hand attacks receive only half the character\u2019s
    Strength bonus, while two-handed attacks receive 1\u20131/2 times the Strength
    bonus. A Strength penalty, but not a bonus, applies to attacks made with a bow
    that is not a composite bow.)\r\nClimb and Swim checks.\r\nStrength checks (for
    breaking down doors and the like).\r\nYour Strength score determines your characters
    carrying capacity.\r\n\r\nTemporary Bonuses: Temporary increases to your Strength
    score give you a bonus on Strength-based skill checks, melee attack rolls, and
    weapon damage rolls (if they rely on Strength). The bonus also applies to your
    Combat Maneuver Bonus (if you are Small or larger) and to your Combat Maneuver
    Defense.\r\n\r\nPermanent Bonuses: Ability bonuses with a duration greater than
    1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all
    skills and statistics as appropriate. This might cause you to gain skill points,
    hit points, and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case
    they are removed.\r\n\r\nAbility Damage: Damage to your Strength score causes
    you to take penalties on Strength-based skill checks, melee attack rolls, and
    weapon damage rolls (if they rely on Strength). The Ability Damage penalty also
    applies to your Combat Maneuver Bonus (if you are Small or larger) and your Combat
    Maneuver Defense. See Ability Score Damage below."
