  Name: Shot on the Run
  ShortName: Shot on the Run
  Description: You are highly trained in skirmish ranged weapon tactics.
  Benefit: 'When using an attack action with a ranged weapon, you can move both before
    and after the attack, provided that your total distance moved is not greater than
    your speed.

    Moving in this way does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender
    you are attacking (though it can provoke attacks of opportunity from others, as
    normal.)'
