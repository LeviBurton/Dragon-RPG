  ShortName: Double Tap
  Description: You can make two quick shots with a firearm as a single attack.
  Benefit: 'When using a semiautomatic firearm with at least tow bullets loaded, you
    may fire two bullets as a single attack against a single target.  You receive
    a -2 penalty on this attack, but you deal +1 die of damage with a successful hit.  For
    example, a firearm that normally deals 2d6 points of damage instead deals 3d6.

    Using this feat fires two bullets and can only be done if thte weapon has two
    bullets in it.'
